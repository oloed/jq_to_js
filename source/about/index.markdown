When working on the web, one of the essential tools in the front-end developer's inventory is jQuery. It's a superb JavaScript library. Wrestling the DOM becomes enjoyable; cross-browser headaches are miraculously healed; you don't have to be a network engineer to send an Ajax request; you might as well not have to know JavaScript at all. Life is peachy...or is it?

You can attempt to use jQuery without knowing how JavaScript or the DOM or Ajax or any of that stuff works. You can also fly an airplane on autopilot without knowing anything about the physics of lift and drag, but if something goes wrong, you're going to crash and burn. Websites crash and burn all the time, and if you don't understand how you're building your own sites, you could get hurt.

As great as jQuery is, there are some potential downsides to using it all the time. If you only need a method or two and file size is a concern (We're in the mobile age now. File size is a concern.) your app could be slimmed down by rolling your own solutions. If you're only targeting modern browsers you might not need all of the cross-browser fixes.

If you've ever been tempted to list "jQuery Programmer" as a skill on you're résumé, we're here to help. From jQuery to JavaScript is here to help you learn JavaScript and programming by using familiar examples from jQuery. Come to where unicorns roam freely and everything tastes like cotton candy. Open your mind, learn JavaScript, and let the inner programming genius that's been hiding behind that $() bling come out and shine.

## The Authors

Daniel Marino is a UX designer & front-end developer at Cramer Dev. He, like many other designers, learned jQuery and thought he was the shizzle. Then he took the leap into JavaScript and really became the shizzle. When he isn't pushing pixels around on a screen he enjoys hanging out with his wife and kids, reading, and playing drums and guitar really loud.

Nathan L Smith is a developer at Cramer Dev. His brain seems to have an affinity for JavaScript, works in much the same way, and has many of the same flaws, so they get along well together. He can get everything done for you, but maybe not in the order you expected. He lives in Iowa City with his wife, son, and cat.
